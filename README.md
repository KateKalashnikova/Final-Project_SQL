# Final-Project_SQL
The final project of MTA Database Fundamentals course.
## The Objective
*	Use “Grade Record” dataset (either use the entire dataset or the first 50 record).
*	Create a master table that will hold your entire dataset.
*	Normalize the dataset into third normal form.
*	Identify primary and foreign keys for your tables.
*	Use JOIN to create a consolidated table.
*	Present your code to class.
## Implementation
### Conceptual Design (ERD). 
* the Master table was broken down into 3 tables: Students, Exams, Final Grades to comply with 2NF and 3NF
* Identified primary and foreign keys for the tables.

### Relational view of the tables.

### Check for duplicate records to comply with 1NF. 
* This step was challenging as there are several methods to check for and delete duplicates and it required a thorough research to find the way that suited the best in my situation. I ended up using GROUP BY and HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 to check for duplicates and than if ound, delete them using MAX function. No duplicates found, 1NF complied.
### Use JOIN to create a consolidated table.
* Created consolidated table 'StudentsGrades' with Students, Exams, StudentAverage and grades rate (rate will be used to created views and sort students by their grade rates)

* Views were created using JOIN, for example, to show students with A and B grades only, or students who failed.
